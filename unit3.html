                <br><br>
                Cache memory is used to reduce the average time required to access data from the main memory.
                <b>The cache stores the most frequently accessed data, so the CPU can quickly access the data it needs

                <br><br>
                There are typically three levels of cache memory in a computer: L1, L2, and L3.
                <br>
                L1 cache is the fastest cache memory and L3 cache is the slowest cache memory while L2 cache is slower

            <h2 class="topic"> <br>.Primary Memory (RAM,ROM,BIOS)</h2>
            <h3>primary memory</h3>
            <p class="pera">Primary memory is a term used to describe a type of computer memory that is directly
                accessible by the CPU (Central Processing Unit). Primary memory is also known as "main memory" or
                "system memory." It is used to store data and instructions that the CPU needs to access immediately in
                order to execute a program.
                <br><br>
                There are two main types of primary memory: RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory). RAM
                is volatile memory,<b> which means it is wiped clean when the computer is turned off. ROM is
                    non-volatile memory, which means it retains its data even when the power is off</b>.
                <br><br>

                RAM is used to store data and instructions that are being actively used or modified by the CPU. It is a
                fast type of memory, but it is also expensive and has limited capacity. ROM, on the other hand, is used
                to store instructions and data that are not expected to change, such as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output
                System) of a computer. ROM is slower and less expensive than RAM, but it is also less flexible because
                it is read-only.

            </p>

            <br><br><br>
            <hr class="hr2">
            <h3>RAM</h3>
            <p class="pera">RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and
                instructions that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) can access quickly. RAM is volatile memory, which
                means it is wiped clean when the computer is turned off.
                <br><br>
                RAM is an essential part of a computer, as it is used to store the data and instructions that the CPU
                needs to access in order to execute a program. <b> When you open a program on your computer, the
                    instructions and data for that program are loaded from storage (such as a hard drive) into RAM</b>,
                where the CPU can access them. This allows the CPU to access the data and instructions much more quickly
                than if it had to retrieve them from storage, which is much slower.
                <br><br>
                RAM is a type of primary memory, which means it is directly accessible by the CPU. It is different from
                secondary memory, such as a hard drive or solid state drive, which is used to store data and
                instructions that are not being actively used by the CPU.

            <h3>How data stored in RAM</h3>
            <p class="pera">RAM stands for random access memory, and it is used to store data that is being used or
                processed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). When a computer is powered on, the <b>
                    operating system and other programs are loaded from the hard drive or SSD into RAM. The data in RAM
                    is stored in the form of binary digits (bits)</b>, with each bit being represented by either a 0 or
                1.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b> RAM is volatile memory, which means it is wiped clean when the computer is turned off. This is in
                    contrast to non-volatile storage devices like hard drives and SSDs, which retain data even when the
                    power is turned off</b>.
                <br><br>
                RAM chips are typically made up of millions of transistors, which are tiny electronic switches that can
                store a single bit of data. The data in RAM is stored on the transistor as either a voltage or the
                absence of a voltage, with the voltage representing a 1 and the absence of a voltage representing a 0.
                The data in RAM is organized into memory cells, with each cell able to store a single bit.

            <p class="pera">BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System

                <br>When a computer is powered on, the BIOS performs a power-on self-test (POST) to check that all of
                the hardware is functioning properly. It then looks for a bootable device, such as a hard drive or
                DVD-ROM drive, and loads the operating system from that device into memory.
                <br><br>
                The BIOS also provides an interface that allows the user to configure basic system settings, such as the
                date and time, the boot order of devices, and the system's power management settings. This is typically
                done through a BIOS setup utility, which is accessed by pressing a specific key during the boot process.

            <h3>Structure of Hard disks</h3>
            <p class="pera">A hard drive is a physical device that stores data on a computer. It consists of a spinning
                disk (or disks) coated with a magnetic material, and a read/write head that reads and writes data to the
                disk. The disk is divided into a series of tracks and sectors, which are used to store data. The tracks
                are concentric circles on the surface of the disk, and the sectors are pie-shaped wedges that are used
                to divide each track into smaller units.

                <br><br>
                When you save a file to a hard drive, the data is stored in a specific location on the disk. The
                location is specified by the track and sector where the data is written. The read/write head moves to
                the correct location on the disk and writes the data to the surface of the disk. When you want to access
                a file, the read/write head moves to the correct location on the disk and reads the data from the
                surface of the disk.

            <h3>How data stored in Hard disks</h3>
            <p class="pera">Data is stored on a hard drive by writing it to the surface of the disk (or disks) in the
                hard drive. The hard drive contains a read/write head that is used to write data to the disk and read
                data from the disk.
                <br><br>
                When you save a file to a hard drive, the data is divided into small units called sectors. Each sector
                can hold a specific amount of data, usually 512 bytes. The data is written to the surface of the disk in
                the sectors. The sectors are organized into tracks, which are concentric circles on the surface of the
                disk.
                <br><br>
                <b>The read/write head moves to the correct location on the disk (specified by the track and sector
                    where the data is to be written) and writes the data to the surface of the disk. When you want to
                    access a file, the read/write head moves to the correct location on the disk and reads the data from
                    the surface of the disk</b>.

              <h3>treaks</h3>
             <p class="pera">a track is a concentric circle on the surface of the disk. The hard drive's read/write head can access data on a specific track by moving to a position above the track and reading or writing data from the surface of the disk.
         <br><br>
                Tracks are used to store data on a hard drive. The hard drive's read/write head can access a specific track by moving to the correct position above the track. The tracks on a hard drive are typically organized into a series of concentric circles, with the innermost track being the first track and the outermost track being the last track.</p>
               <br>
           <h3>sectors</h3>
           <p class="pera">A sector is a small unit of data storage on a hard drive's disk. It is used to store data on the hard drive and is organized into tracks on the disk. Each sector can hold a specific amount of data, usually 512 bytes. The hard drive's read/write head accesses data by moving to the correct track and sector. When you save a file to a hard drive, the data is divided into sectors and written to the surface of the disk in the appropriate track and sector. When you want to access a file, the read/write head moves to the correct track and sector and reads the data from the surface of the disk.</p>
           <br>
           <h3>cluster</h3>
           <p class="pera"> <b>cluster is a group of sectors</b>  that are used to store data. Clusters are the smallest unit of storage on a hard drive and are used to store files and directories. When you save a file to a hard drive, the data is divided into clusters and written to the surface of the disk in the appropriate track and sector. The size of a cluster is determined by the size of the hard drive and the file system being used. Smaller clusters result in more efficient use of disk space, but also result in more overhead when storing small files. Larger clusters are less efficient, but have less overhead when storing small files.</p>

           <h3>cylender</h3>
           <p class="pera">cylinder is a group of tracks that are located at the same position on the disk. Cylinders are used to organize data on a hard drive and are typically used in older hard drive designs. In a modern hard drive, the read/write head can access any track on the disk, regardless of its position, so the concept of cylinders is not as important as it once was. However, the term "cylinder" is still used in some contexts to refer to a group of tracks on a hard drive.</p>

          <h3>magnatic tape</h3>
          <p class="pera">Magnetic tape is a type of storage medium that uses magnetism to store and retrieve data. It consists of a long, narrow strip of plastic film coated with a magnetic material, and a read/write head that reads and writes data to the tape.

            Magnetic tape is used for long-term storage of data and is commonly used for data backup and archiving. It has the advantage of being able to store large amounts of data in a small space, and it is relatively inexpensive compared to other types of storage media. However, it is slower to access data stored on magnetic tape compared to other types of storage, such as hard drives or solid-state drives.</p>
