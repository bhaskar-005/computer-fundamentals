            <h2 class="topic">.software and its need</h2>
            <p class="pera">Software refers to a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and
                execute specific tasks. It is a vital component of modern computers, and nearly every computer uses a
                variety of different software to perform a wide range of tasks.
                <br><br>
                There are many different types of software, including operating systems, productivity software, and
                applications for specific tasks such as photo editing or gaming.
                <br><br>
                <b>The need for software </b>arises from the fact that humans are generally not very good at
                communicating with computers using machine language, which consists of a series of zeros and ones that
                the computer reads in order to execute instructions. Software provides a way for humans to communicate
                with computers using a language that is easier for humans to understand, such as English.

            <h3>defination of operating system</h3>
            <p class="pera">
                An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and
                provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of
                system software in a computer system.
                <br><br>
                An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks
                and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system
                performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing system requests,
                controlling input and output devices, facilitating networking, and managing file systems.
                <br><br>
                Some examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

            <h3>history of operating system</h3>
            <p class="pera">The history of operating systems dates back to the early 1950s, when the first computers
                were built. At that time, computers were large, expensive, and difficult to use, so they were used
                primarily by scientists and researchers.
                <br><br>
                The first operating systems were very basic and only provided a few functions. They were used to manage
                the computer's resources and run a single program at a time.
                <br><br>
                Over time, operating systems became more sophisticated and began to support multiple programs running
                concurrently. This allowed users to perform multiple tasks at the same time, greatly improving the
                efficiency of the computer.
                <br><br>
                As computers became smaller and more affordable, they became widely available for personal use. This led
                to the development of operating systems designed specifically for personal computers, such as Microsoft
                Windows and MacOS.
                <br><br>
                Today, there are many different types of operating systems in use, including those for personal
                computers, servers, smartphones, and embedded systems in devices such as cars and appliances.

                    <h1 class="memo1">Operating System Functions</h1>
                    <p class="pera">An operating system (OS) is a critical component of any computer system, serving as
                        the interface between the hardware and the software. The OS performs a variety of functions to
                        ensure that the computer system runs smoothly and efficiently.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Resource Management</h2>
                    <p class="pera">One of the main functions of an operating system is resource management. The OS is
                        responsible for allocating hardware resources such as memory, processors, and input/output
                        devices to different programs and processes running on the system. This helps to ensure that
                        each program has the resources it needs to function properly, while also preventing one program
                        from consuming all of the available resources and negatively impacting the performance of the
                        system.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Memory Management</h2>

                        manages the use of memory in the system, ensuring that programs can access the memory they need
                        to run and that multiple programs can run concurrently without interfering with each other.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic"> Process Management</h2>
                    <p class="pera">In addition to resource and memory management, the operating system also performs
                        process management. This involves controlling the execution of programs and allocating resources
                        to them as needed. The OS also provides a mechanism for communication between programs, allowing
                        them to exchange data and interact with each other.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">File Management</h2>
                    <p class="pera">The operating system also plays a critical role in file management, providing a file
                        system to store and organize data and a set of commands to manipulate the files. This allows
                        users to easily access and modify their files as needed.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Security</h2>
                    <p class="pera">Security is another important function of the operating system. The OS includes a
                        variety of security features to protect against unauthorized access to the system and to keep
                        data safe. This can include user authentication, file permissions, and other measures.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Networking</h2>
                    <p class="pera">Finally, the operating system provides networking capabilities, allowing the
                        computer to communicate with other devices on a network. This allows users to share files and
                        resources, and enables the system to access the internet and other networked resources.</p>

                    <p class="pera">In the world of computing, there are several techniques that allow a computer to
                        perform multiple tasks simultaneously. These techniques, known as multiprogramming,
                        multitasking, multithreading, multiprocessing, multiuser, time sharing, and real-time computing,
                        allow a computer to run multiple programs or processes at the same time, making it more
                        efficient and capable of handling a greater workload.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Multiprogramming</h2>
                    <p class="pera">Multiprogramming is a technique that allows a computer to run multiple programs
                        concurrently. With multiprogramming, the computer's central processing unit (CPU) can switch
                        between different tasks quickly, giving the appearance that all of the tasks are being executed
                        simultaneously. This allows users to run multiple programs at the same time, such as a word
                        processor and a web browser.</p>
                    <h2 class="topic">Multitasking</h2>
                    <p class="pera">Multitasking is a technique that allows an operating system (OS) to run multiple
                        programs or processes concurrently. With multitasking, the OS can switch between different tasks
                        quickly, giving the appearance that all of the tasks are being executed simultaneously. This
                        allows users to run multiple programs at the same time, such as a word processor and a web

                    <h1 class="memo1">Real-Time Operating Systems</h1>
                    <p class="pera">A real-time operating system (RTOS) is a type of operating system designed to handle
                        the execution of real-time applications. Real-time applications are applications that require a
                        prompt and deterministic response to events, such as control systems, industrial automation
                        systems, and other applications that require a timely response to external events. In contrast
                        to a general-purpose operating system, which may have variable and unpredictable response times,
                        an RTOS is designed to provide a predictable and consistent response time to events.</p>
                    <p class="pera">RTOSs are typically used in embedded systems, which are systems that are built into
                        a larger device or system and are not intended to be used as a standalone computer. RTOSs are
                        used in a wide range of applications, including automotive systems, medical devices, industrial
                        control systems, and aerospace systems. Some examples of RTOSs include VxWorks, QNX, and
                        FreeRTOS.</p>
                    <p class="pera">One of the key features of an RTOS is its ability to prioritize tasks and events. In
                        an RTOS, tasks and events are assigned a priority level, and the RTOS schedules the execution of
                        tasks based on their priority level. This allows the RTOS to ensure that critical tasks and
                        events are given priority over less important tasks, improving the overall reliability and
                        performance of the system.</p>
                    <p class="pera">In summary, a real-time operating system is a specialized type of operating system
                        designed to handle the execution of real-time applications. RTOSs are used in a wide range of
